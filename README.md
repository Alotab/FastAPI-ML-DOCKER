# FastAPI-AI-DOCKER

This repository contains a machine learning app that is integrated with FastAPI and dockerized for easy deployment. The machine learning model used in this project is sourced from HuggingFace.io, a leading provider of state-of-the-art natural language processing models.

The app allows users to upload an image and ask the model questions about the contents of the picture. For example, you could ask “How many dogs do you see in the picture?” or “What is the position of the dog?”. The model will then analyze the image and provide an answer to your question.

This project showcases the power of machine learning and its ability to extract information from visual data. It’s a great example of how cutting-edge technology can be used to create practical and useful applications.
